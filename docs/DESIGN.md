# Brunnen-G Identity System Documentation

## Overview

Brunnen-G implements a decentralized public key infrastructure using hardware security modules, blockchain persistence, and quantum-resistant cryptography. The system enables passwordless authentication without central authorities.

## Core Identity Equation

Each identity is computed as:
```
identity = h(h(tpm_pubkey) || h(dilithium(h(emercoin_signature))) || tpm_nonce || h(yubikey))
```

### Components

**TPM Public Key**
- Hardware-generated key that never leaves the TPM
- Provides root of trust anchored in silicon
- Enables secure nonce generation for zero-knowledge proofs

**Emercoin Domain Signature**
- Proves domain ownership through blockchain
- Signs the TPM public key with domain's private key
- Creates binding between hardware and blockchain identity

**Dilithium Signature**
- Post-quantum cryptographic signature
- Signs the Emercoin signature for quantum resistance
- NIST-approved algorithm (FIPS 204)

**TPM Nonce**
- Fresh randomness for each authentication
- Prevents replay attacks
- Enables zero-knowledge property

**YubiKey Component**
- PIV certificate stored in slot 9a
- Requires physical touch for operations
- Acts as uncopyable bearer token

## Registration Process

### Step 1: Identity Generation
1. TPM generates keypair (stays in hardware)
2. Domain owner signs TPM public key
3. Dilithium signs the domain signature
4. YubiKey generates certificate

### Step 2: Database Aggregation
1. Domain collects all identity records
2. Computes merkle root of identity set
3. Publishes database to IPFS
4. Stores only reference on blockchain:
   ```
   trust:domain.coin = {
     "cid": "QmHash...",
     "merkle_root": "0xabc123..."
   }
   ```

**Limitation**: Individual identities are not stored on-chain to reduce costs. Users must trust IPFS availability or maintain local copies.

## Verification Process

### Fast Path (Bloom Filter)
- O(1) lookup to check if identity might exist
- Prevents expensive operations on invalid identities
- Sub-microsecond response time

### Standard Path (Database)
1. Fetch domain's database from IPFS
2. Verify merkle root matches blockchain
3. Query local database for identity
4. Extract public keys and signatures

### Merkle Proof Path (Lightweight)
1. User provides merkle proof with identity data
2. Verify proof against blockchain merkle root
3. No database download required
4. Instant verification with minimal data

### Authentication Flow
1. Verifier generates random nonce via TPM
2. Sends nonce challenge to user
3. User signs (previous_hashes + nonce) with YubiKey
4. Verifier checks signature against stored public key
5. Physical touch required on YubiKey

## Zero-Knowledge Properties

**What the verifier learns:**
- Identity exists and is valid
- User currently possesses the hardware

**What remains secret:**
- All private keys
- Internal computation methods
- Hardware-specific details

## Database Structure

### Enhanced Schema with Merkle Proofs

**address_keys table**
```
- identity_hash: Full computed identity hash
- tpm_pubkey: TPM public key
- dilithium_pubkey: Post-quantum public key
- dilithium_sig: Domain signature
- yubikey_cert: PIV certificate
- merkle_proof: JSON array of proof nodes
- merkle_index: Leaf position in tree
```

**db_root table**
```
- merkle_root: Current root hash
- identity_count: Total identities
- tree_height: Merkle tree depth
- timestamp: Last update time
```

### User Experience Benefits

With merkle proofs stored per user:
- Offline verification using only proof + root
- Mobile-friendly (no large DB downloads)
- Instant identity verification
- Privacy-preserving (don't reveal all users)

Users can export their proof as QR code or file for truly portable identity verification.

### Per-Identity Storage
- Not stored individually on blockchain
- Aggregated into domain databases
- Merkle proofs enable membership verification

### Domain-Level Operations
- Batch identity updates daily/weekly
- Single blockchain transaction per batch
- IPFS distributes full database
- Nodes cache frequently accessed domains

### Cost Model
- ~$0.01 per domain update (not per user)
- Users prove membership via merkle proof
- Database downloads amortized across queries

## Security Properties

**Hardware Binding**
- Private keys physically locked in TPM/YubiKey
- Cannot be extracted even with root access
- Survives OS compromise

**Quantum Resistance**
- Dilithium signatures resist quantum attacks
- Hash functions provide 256-bit quantum security
- Forward-secure design

**Physical Presence**
- YubiKey touch prevents remote attacks
- Rate-limited by human interaction
- Visible security indicator

**No Single Point of Failure**
- Any node can verify identities
- No central certificate authority
- Blockchain provides persistence

## Domain Certificate Authority

Domains can operate as their own CA:
1. Generate domain TPM keypair
2. Create self-signed CA certificate
3. Sign certificate hash with TPM
4. Publish to blockchain as `ca:domain.coin`

This enables:
- Domain-issued TLS certificates
- Service authentication
- Code signing
- Email encryption

## Network Integration

**API Access**
- REST endpoints for verification
- HMAC-authenticated requests
- Standard HTTP status codes (200/403)

**VoIP Support**
- Identity-based dialing (user@domain.coin)
- Asterisk AGI integration
- SIP over Yggdrasil mesh

**PAM Module**
- System login via Brunnen-G identity
- Replaces passwords for SSH/sudo
- Offline verification capability

## Implementation Requirements

**Hardware**
- TPM 2.0 chip
- YubiKey with PIV support
- Standard x86/ARM processor

**Software**
- Emercoin blockchain node
- IPFS daemon
- Python 3.8+ runtime
- tpm2-tools package

**Network**
- Internet connectivity for updates
- Yggdrasil mesh (optional)
- Local database cache

## Operational Considerations

**Backup Strategy**
- TPM handles are hardware-specific
- YubiKey can be duplicated for redundancy
- Blockchain provides automatic backup

**Key Rotation**
- Generate new identity components
- Update blockchain record
- Maintain old identity during transition

**Monitoring**
- Transaction logs for audit trail
- Merkle root changes indicate updates
- Domain expiration warnings
